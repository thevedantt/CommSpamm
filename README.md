# CommSpamm

**CommSpamm** is a Jupyter Notebook-based project for classifying YouTube-style comments as spam or not spam, and for detecting vulgar, abusive, or inappropriate language in user-generated content.  
It uses machine learning (Bernoulli Naive Bayes with TF-IDF features), and leverages Google Gemini for fallback classification and explanation when model confidence is low, as well as for synthetic data augmentation and vulgarity detection.

---

## Features

- **Spam Detection:** Classifies comments as "Spam Comment" or "Not Spam" using a trained ML model.
- **Vulgarity Detection:** Detects and lists vulgar, abusive, or inappropriate words in comments.
- **Active Learning:** Uses Gemini for low-confidence cases and to generate explanations.
- **Data Augmentation:** Augments training data with synthetic spam/non-spam comments generated by Gemini.
- **Batch Processing:** Accepts paragraphs or multiple comments (split by dot, newline, or space).
- **Jupyter Notebook Ready:** Written for interactive use.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thevedantt/CommSpamm.git
    cd CommSpamm
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    - Python 3.8+ recommended
    - Install required packages (e.g., via pip):
        ```bash
        pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
        ```
    - You will need access to Google Gemini API (or replace with OpenAI/GPT if desired).

3. **Download the dataset:**
    - Place the YouTube Spam Collection CSVs in a folder (default: `/content/youtube-spam-collection-v1`).
    - Each CSV should have at least `CONTENT` and `CLASS` columns.

## Usage

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. **Open and run the notebook containing the main code.**

3. **Follow the prompts:**
    - Enter a paragraph or list of comments when prompted.
    - The notebook will classify each comment as spam or not, and detect any vulgar language.

**Example output:**
```
üîç SPAM CLASSIFICATION RESULTS:
‚Ä¢ [Spam Comment] Subscribe to this channel and win an iPhone!
‚Ä¢ [Not Spam] Thanks for the informative video.

üö´ VULGARITY DETECTION RESULTS:
‚Ä¢ Get lost, idiot!
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulgar/Offensive Words: idiot
```

## Data Augmentation

This project can automatically augment its training data by generating new spam and non-spam comments using Gemini.

---

## Customization

- **Change model:** You can swap out the BernoulliNB for another classifier if desired.
- **Replace Gemini:** If you don't have access to Gemini, you can use OpenAI or another LLM for fallback and data generation.
- **Dataset location:** Set the `folder_path` variable to your dataset location.
